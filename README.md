# Coral Health Classification with CNN

This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model designed to distinguish between healthy and bleached corals using image data. Coral reefs are critical biomarkers for water purity and overall marine ecosystem health. With the increasing threat of climate change and pollution, monitoring coral health is essential for environmental conservation efforts.
## Project Overview

IslandCity's coastal regions rely heavily on the purity of their waters, both for the well-being of their marine life and the overall health of their environment. Corals, being sensitive to changes in water quality, serve as vital indicators of ecological balance. This project aims to support IslandCityâ€™s conservation efforts by providing a robust and accurate tool for monitoring coral health.

## Features
* CNN-Based Image Classification: Utilizes deep learning techniques to accurately classify coral images as either healthy or bleached.
* Automated Monitoring: Facilitates continuous and automated monitoring of coral reefs, providing timely data to environmental agencies.
* Data Augmentation: Employs image data augmentation to enhance the model's ability to generalize and perform well on unseen data.
* Fine-Tuning with RandomSearch: Optimizes model hyperparameters using Keras Tuner's RandomSearch, improving model performance and accuracy.
* Early Stopping and Regularization: Incorporates advanced techniques to prevent overfitting and improve model robustness.

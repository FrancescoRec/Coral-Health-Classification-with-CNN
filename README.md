# Coral-Health-Classification-with-CNN
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model designed to distinguish between healthy and bleached corals using image data. Coral reefs are critical biomarkers for water purity and overall marine ecosystem health. With the increasing threat of climate change and pollution, monitoring coral health is essential for environmental conservation efforts.
